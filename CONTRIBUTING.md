## Contributing Rules and Guidelines

+ Only create new releases within mutual agreement with project leadership. Releases may have custom titles, but the tags must follow the version naming standard of *"vA.B.C"*, with A being a major update, B being a minor update and C being a bugfix or small update. Please make release notes as extensive as possible.
+ With the exception of *special* circumstances, **do not commit to master**. Work on a feature or bug fix in a **new branch** and submit a PR (pull request) once completed. When approved, merge it once finished and bug free to master.
+ **Commit useful changes**. _Committing comments, spaces, indents, regions and minor grammatical errors_ without any other bug fixes or features is _prohibited_. This is known as **commit farming**, and doing so may cause moderative action.
+ Do not commit blank files with no content in them. This is also commit farming.
+ If merge conflicts are present, create a pull request before attempting to merge it yourself. Higher management must approve your merge.
+ _Name commits_ with **brief and suitable names**. eg. "Added Supermode Setting". A bad example of a commit title would be "Owo" or "made johnsys code better lol it was so bad"
+ _Describe commits_ with **indepth, descriptive descriptions**. eg. "Character.cs: Added method wd() for printing text to console more effectively & made colour changes happen internally, inside the function." A bad example of a commit description would be "i fixed som bugs and added another method for the thing i worked on yesterday."
+ **Communicate** any major changes with other members. When deleting code, make sure it is okay to delete. Even if it may seem useless, someone else may be working on it. _Do not blindly change code that you are unsure of the function of._
+ Make sure grammar is on point. Proofread sentences. Use British English standard for spelling when possible. (Exceptions being keywords built into C# with American English)
+ **DO NOT COMMIT ANY CODE TO MASTER, OR MERGE AND CODE FROM A BRANCH TO MASTER THAT THROWS A BUILD ERROR. TEST ALL CODE BEFORE COMMITTING IT!**

Failure to do these may result in citation by other contributors. Please help us build a healthy community.
