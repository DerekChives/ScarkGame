# Scark
#### Scark is a text-based roleplaying game.

A stable and completed release of the game isn't _fully completed_ as we are in early stages of development. If anyone passing by wishes to play the game, bare in mind bugs and loopholes are **inevitable** and the story isn't very long.

Scark is programmed in C# using the layout of a C# console app.
