You have been arrested for treason to the king. You are walked up to the gallows to which you will be 
executed. The executioner firms his grasp around the lever. before he pulls the lever he mumbles a 
quick prayer. The executioner asks if anybody objects when legendary explorer “Lord Wakehart” says that 
you could be of service to him. his lordship allows him to pardon anybody he wishes. He asks you "what's 
your name?" "/* input */" then tells you that he desperately needs an explorer to go to the island of 
Scark. He promises you a fortune if you complete his quest. Before you can say anything you are rushed 
off to a training fort. The trainer asks you how you like to fight "/*input*/" you are trained basically 
in (*put class here*)and shipped to scark.
