You carefully aim your crossbow directly at the King's chest.
>1500
A bloodstained crossbow loaded with a lead bolt sits in your sweaty hand as you observe the speech from a ramshackle building.
>1500
Your finger pulls the trigger.
>1500
You hear an instant uproar as the King's body topples down the stone stairs.
>1500
In the midst of all the confusion, you begin running.
>1500
Suddenly, a baton bludgeons you from behind.
>10000
You wake up in a mysterious place and realize where you are...
>1500
You have been arrested for treason to the king. You are walked up to the gallows to which you will be executed.
>1500
The executioner firms his grasp around the lever. Before he pulls the lever he mumbles a quick prayer.
>1500
[EXECUTIONER] Does anybody object to this her' hanging?
>1500
Silence.
>1500
As the executioner moves his hand towards the lever, a voice shouts out.
>1500
[VOICE] I object!
>1500
The executioner's eyes fix upon the man who called.
>1500
[EXECUTIONER] Arr, an' who d'ya think you ar'?
>1500
[VOICE] Lord Wakehart, the explorer.
>1500
[LORD WAKEHART] I wish to pardon this kid.
>1500
The executioner has no choice but to obey the laws, Wakehart's lordship grants him power to pardon anyone he wishes.
>1500
The rope is loosened around your neck as you are escorted into the disappointed audience by Lord Wakehart.
>1500
[LORD WAKEHART] Hey kid, what's your name?
>1500
